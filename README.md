##Password Generator Application Walkthrough
<!-- This JavaScript code generates a secure password based on user-defined criteria. It utilizes browser-side JavaScript to interact with the DOM and generate passwords dynamically. -->

##HTML Structure
<!-- Assuming there's an HTML file that includes a button with the id generate and an input field with the id password, the JavaScript code interacts with these elements to generate and display passwords. -->

##Functionality
    <!-- When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button (generateBtn), the writePassword function is triggered.
    The writePassword function calls the generatePassword function to generate a password based on user-defined criteria.
    The generatePassword function prompts the user for password options (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters) and adjusts the character set accordingly.
    After generating the password, it sets the value of the password input field (passwordText) to the generated password.
    Users can customize the length and character types of the generated password based on their preferences.
    The generated password is displayed in the input field for the user to copy and use. -->
